## Introduction
**Fruitful Farming** is an upcoming Minecraft datapack that aims to add 60+ different kinds of crops, mobs, mechanics, items, enchantments, and blocks that each focus on different aspects of agriculture and fishery! 

### Gameplay
Different plants have certain conditions that have to be met for them to grow and be cultivated. Some plants may drain the soil of water, some may drain the soil of nutrients. Some plants require plantation under specific light conditions, some plants need to be planted in different temperatures. There are new redstone components that help in automating and keeping crops healthy, and a bunch more features that cater best to Minecraft's beloved farmers!
