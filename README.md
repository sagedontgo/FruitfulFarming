## Introduction
**Fruitful Farming** is an upcoming Minecraft datapack that aims to add 60+ different kinds of crops, mobs, mechanics, items, enchantments, and blocks that each focus on different aspects of agriculture and fishery! 

### Gameplay
Different plants have certain conditions that have to be met for them to grow and be cultivated. Some plants may drain the soil of water, some may drain the soil of nutrients. Some plants require plantation under specific light conditions, some plants need to be planted in different temperatures. There are new redstone components that help in automating and keeping crops healthy, and a bunch more features that cater best to Minecraft's beloved farmers!

### Fertilizers
**Fertilizers** only work on custom crops, and bone meal has no effect on said crops. There are 5 different fertilizer types: Basic, Compost, Mineral, Fish Meal, and Magical.

Basic fertilizers are crafted with 5 dirt and 3 bone meal. They provide little fertilization and little growth boost, but is the cheapest option.

<h3><img align="center" height="60" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/701654d7-e17d-4787-a126-ae6a20fa563d"> <b>Compost</b></h3>
Compost fertilizers are crafted with 3 of any seed, 3 dirt, and 3 rotten flesh. They provide more fertilization and growth boosts than the basic fertilizer, and is the most convenient.

<h3><img align="center" height="60" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96e935f2-90c1-4af5-949f-a9ed8565fde3"> <b>Fish Meal</b></h3>
Fish meals are crafted with 8 of any raw fish and 32 dried kelp. A slightly more annoying fertilizer to obtain, fish meals provide the most fertilization and growth boosts of every fertilizer, excluding the magical fertilizer. But, too much of it, and the crop will die.

<h3><img align="center" height="60" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb872bed-32ff-42a7-857e-558ad2e7dcb9"> <b>Mineral</b></h3>
Mineral fertilizers are crafted with 8 flint and 1 basic fertilizer. They provide just a bit more fertilization and growth boost than the basic fertilizer, but additionally give nutrients to the crop that it may need. (e.g, Iron)

<h3><img align="center" height="60" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f728cdb-14f4-414b-be49-33e2daae1df3"> <b>Magical</b></h3>
Magical fertilizers have little use value and are much more expensive to craft, requiring 3 blaze powder, 5 gold nuggets, and 1 fish meal. They have the special ability of growing a crop to full maturity.
